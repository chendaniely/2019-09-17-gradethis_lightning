# Interactive Tutorials for R

The `learnr` package  turns any R Markdown document into an interactive tutorial

- https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/

You can now add sections in a tutorial to reinforce or access learning objectives.



1. Narrative, figures, illustrations, and equations.
2. Videos (supported services include YouTube and Vimeo).
3. Interactive Shiny components.
4. **Code exercises (R code chunks that users can edit and execute directly).**
5. **Quiz questions.**

Examples:

1. https://jjallaire.shinyapps.io/learnr-tutorial-01-data-basics/
2. https://jjallaire.shinyapps.io/learnr-tutorial-03a-data-manip-filter
3. https://jjallaire.shinyapps.io/learnr-tutorial-03c-data-manip-summarise/

Not just tell you the solution is wrong, but gives a way for

1. The instructor to give feedback
2. Give you a hint where your code is incorrect
   - You used `tidyr::spread` where I expected a call to `tidyr::pivot_wider`
   - You passed in `3` where I expected `2`
